            Hello! My name is Malwandla Shaun Hlungwani and I am a software
            developer with over two years of experience building web
            applications with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Express,
            and Node.
          </p>
          <p>
            I received my education from Gidjana High School, where I excelled
            in Mathematics and Physical Sciences, earning outstanding grades.
            Later, I studied Chemistry and Mathematics at Wits University, where
            I majored in these fields and earned distinctions in Multivariable
            Calculus and Abstract Mathematics. Since then, I have continued to
            expand my knowledge and skills through various online resources and
            courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I have completed a variety of projects that have
            helped me develop my expertise in web development. Some notable
            projects include Netflix Clone, spotify Clone, and e-commerce
            websites. These projects have given me experience in:

            <!-- Skills will be rendered here -->
          </ul>

          <p>
            In addition to my projects, I also have freelancing experience,
            which has taught me how to work with clients, other developers and
            also building responsive, accessible, and performant applications.
            During my time as a freelancer, I contributed to various projects
            and accomplishments.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games and Video editing.
            My passion for these hobbies has taught me valuable skills, such as
            attention to detail, creativity, and storytelling, which I apply to
            my software development work to create engaging and intuitive user
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as
            a software developer. If you're interested in learning more about me
            or my work, please visit my portfolio website at
